# zonk

Routine, habit, and time tracker, planner, and manager.

> Note: This project is currently very much a work-in-progress.
> I had been motivated to make this project out of dissatisfaction with currently-available time and habit management apps for ADHD. The goal of this project is to make an app that combines just about all of the features that I want in a time/habit management apps, introduce/experiment around with some new features, and provide it to others free and open-source. (Zonk is just a random name I thought of; will probably change in the future.)

> For now, this document serves as a proposal/specification for what the ideal time/habit management app would look like for me.

## Features

* Automatic scheduling &mdash; After inputting all obligations, the app automatically generates a time-blocked schedule to make sure that all of them can be done, or notifys the user if adjustments need to be made.
* "Do this now" &mdash; to avoid being overwhelmed by having too many things to do, the app gives one task that should be worked on immediately.
* Timeline &mdash; gives visual representation of how time is being spent in a day; similar to time blocking with a spreadsheet
* Routines with timed tasks, similar to Brili. Can also add delays between tasks (e.g. wait for washing machine to finish running; in the meantime, you can do something else)

### Tasks

#### Fixed Obligations

These are things that must done, which have a fixed time at which they must be done, e.g. school, work, meetings, etc.

#### Dynamic Obligations

These are things that must be done, but you get to choose when you want to do them, such as homework.

#### Quality-of-life Tasks

These are things that are very important, but can be skipped in a crunch, such as exercise.
